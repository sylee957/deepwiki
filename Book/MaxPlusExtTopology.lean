# `R̄max` analysis via the `EReal` identity cast

The book's extended real line `R̄max = WithBot (WithTop ℝ)` is *the same nesting*
as `EReal = WithBot (WithTop ℝ)` — defeq as a type — and its dioid product
(numeric `+`) is the *bot-absorbing* addition `(−∞)+(+∞) = −∞`, which is the
**same `Add` instance** as `EReal`'s. So the cast `toEReal` is the identity, the
orders coincide, and `toEReal_add` holds *unconditionally* (no collision
discrepancy, unlike the top-absorbing `R̄min`).

The cast still does work for *analysis*: `EReal`'s topology lives on the `def`
`EReal`, not on the bare synonym `WithBot (WithTop ℝ)`. We give the carrier
`EReal`'s topology by defeq (`scoped`, so it never leaks), making the identity an
honest homeomorphism, and transport `EReal.continuousAt_add`. `EReal` addition is
genuinely discontinuous at the collision pairs `(⊤,⊥)`, `(⊥,⊤)`, so the
continuity statement still carries an `AddDefinedExtMax` hypothesis excluding
them — even though *value* agreement is unconditional.
