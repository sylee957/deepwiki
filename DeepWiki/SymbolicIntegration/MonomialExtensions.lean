/-! # Monomial extensions — normal and special polynomials (Bronstein §3.4)
A *monomial* `t` over a differential field `k` is a transcendental element with `Dt ∈ k[t]`, so
`k[t]` is closed under `D`. Mathlib's `Differential.implicitDeriv v = mapCoeffs + v • d/dX` is
exactly this derivation on `k[X]` with `Dt = v` (`implicitDeriv_X`/`implicitDeriv_C`). A
polynomial is *normal* if it is coprime to its derivative and *special* if it divides its
derivative; special polynomials cut out differential ideals. We work over a general differential
ring (these are derivation/divisibility facts), the monomial case being `R = k[t]`. -/
